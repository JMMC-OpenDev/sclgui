   File:                OSXAdapter.java
   Abstract:   A single class with clear, static entry points for
                           hooking existing preferences, about, quit functionality
                           from an existing Java app into handlers for the Mac OS X
                           application menu.  Useful for developers looking to support
                           multiple platforms with a single codebase, and support
                           Mac OS X features with minimal impact.
