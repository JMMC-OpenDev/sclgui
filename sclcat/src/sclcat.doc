@mainpage sclcat : SearchCal catalogs 

@section Descripton Description
Calibrator catalog created with SearchCal tool.

This modules contains scripts to create catalog of calibrators using SearchCal
tool. For the time beeing, it creates catalog for :
@li @ref refPRIMA

Click on the link for more information.

*/

/**
@page refPRIMA PRIMA

The PRIMA part of the sclcat module creates in sclcat/src a
directory where are stored the result of SearchCal (V3.3.6) for several
reference stars provided by the web site http://exoplanet.eu.

The Results are stored in CSV files. There are one file per stars.
A web page resuming the results is also provided.

The scipt used to generate the PRIMA catalog is <b>sclcatPrima</b>.

For more information about this script, type:
@verbatim
% sclcatPrima -h
Usage: sclcatPrima [-h] [-g] [-c]
        -h      print this help.
        -c      generate the configuration file.
        -g      generate reference.
@endverbatim

All work should be done in the sclcat/src repository.

@par "Re-generate the prima reference stars (Optionnal)"
The number of reference stars provided by the http://exoplanet.eu web site can changed. 
To be sure to use the last version of the prima reference stars,
you need to re-generate the stars reference file \b sclcatPRIMA.cfg in 
\b sclcat/config repository where are stored information for SearchCal 
(ra, dec, etc...).\n
To do this, retreive the catalog at http://exoplanet.eu in the <b> Interactive
Catalog </b> section.\n
Choose <b>All Candidates detected</b>, the catalog will be displayed as an
html table.\n
In the header of the table choose <b>ALL FORMATS</b> and select <b>XML</b> in
the Output format.\n
Then, click <b>Download button</b>. Save the file provided by the web site as
<b>sclcatPrimaExoplanetData.xml</b> in the sclcat/config repository.\n
Once the reference stars are retreived, it is necessary to re-create the
<b>sclcatPRIMA.cfg</b> file, run:
@verbatim
% sclcatPrima -c
@endverbatim
\n
@warning
@li Check in the end of output that all stars are known 
(!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Here comes the not found list: !!!!!!!!!!!!!! should be empty).
If not empty, <b>sclcatAliases.xml</b>  must be completed to permit simbad 
request to star names that come from exoplanet site, to add an aliases,
use following format (in this example, 2M1207 is in the list of unknown stars):
@verbatim
<object name="2M1207"          alias="2MASS J12073346-3932539" />
@endverbatim
Run the script again.
@li <b>sclcatSimbadList.xml</b> is completed automatically by script during configuration process or must be
filled by hand to set object coordinates, proper motions and parallax. If a star
hasn't a property, a message is displayed at the end of the output : "OGLE-TR-10
has no pmra or pmdec" for example. If the property is known, it is possible to
complete the file <b>sclcatSimbadList.xml</b>, using following format:
@verbatim
<!-- add on Wed Jan 31 09:22:38 CET 2007 -->
<object>
<name>47 Uma</name>
<ra>10 59 27.9737</ra>
<dec>+40 25 48.925</dec>
<pmra>-315.92</pmra>
<pmdec>55.15</pmdec>
<plx>71.04</plx>
</object>
@endverbatim
Run the script again.

\n
\par "Research of the PRIMA calibrators"
The next step is the research of PRIMA calibrators. The research uses the
<b>sclcatPRIMA.cfg</b> file where are stored information for each reference star
need by SearchCal.\n
The results of the research are stored in the
sclcat/src/prima-run-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS directory where YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS is
the date of the research beginning.\n
To create the <b>prima-run-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS</b> directory, run :
@verbatim
% sclcatPrima
@endverbatim
A PRIMA reference results directory is provided by the sclcat module in
sclcat/src/prima-ref repository. If the prima-run-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS
repository is the new reference (because new reference stars are found, ...), it
is possible to re-create the prima-ref directory, by running:
@verbatim
% sclcatPrima -g
@endverbatim
After the research, the generation of the web page is done automatically by
calling sclcatPrimaParseResult.
@warning The Research of the PRIMA calibrators could take more than one hour

\par "Generate prima-ref web page"
The web page of the prima-ref directory need to be re-generated because it is
not provided by default with the module.
To generate it, run:
@verbatim
% sclcatPrimaParseResult prima-ref
@endverbatim
The web page is stored in <b>sclcat/src/<prima-run>/html/index.html</b>.

@warning 
timespan is defined several times into several scripts...
