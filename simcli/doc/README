README          This file. It contains the list of the files in the package
                and the history of the successive release.

SIMCLI.DOC      Description of the client routines. These routines are
                used to develop client applications.

Makefile        Typing 'make', it builds the SIMBAD client routines library:
                     libsimcli.a
                and all the demo programmes.

skio.c          Low level socket i/o routines

skclient.c      Low level socket management routines. Client side.

uifclient.c     SIMBAD command level interface routines

simcli.c        SIMBAD query & data level interface routines.

cliopt.c        Function used by the demo programmes. It queries for the
                username and password if they are not provided on the command
                line.

clitest.c       Demo pgm #1
                Returns all data for several predefined queries.
                Uses all routines defined in the package.
                The queries can be overriden by any other one.

clibib.c        Demo pgm #2
                Returns references for several predefined objects.
                These objects can be overriden by any other one.

cliname.c       Demo pgm #3
                Gives a simple example of how a name resolver can be written.

clicoord.c      Demo pgm #4
                Returns just the coordinates for a given object name.

clitime.c       Demo pgm #5
                Queries 500 objects. Displays one dot for each queried object.
                Gives an idea of how fast the client/server works.
                The needed elapsed time is displayed.


Release history:
===============
Release 3.3  -  Jun, 27th 1995

- ANSI C version

- Documentation modification: all the different comment fields are
  described as they are given when they exist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.2  -  Feb, 2nd 1995

- Fixes several bugs concerning empty results and display of bibliographical
  references. New socket interface routines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.1  -  Mar, 1st 1994

- Checks for a normal SIMBAD userid/password for any connection.
  Another check is made by the server on the version number of the client 
  routine. Connections initiated by clients no longer supported by the server
  will be refused.

- All the demo programmes need a true userid/password. They can be typed on
  the command line (Ex: clitest userid passwd), or, if not, they will be
  prompted (Ex: if you type "clitest userid", only the password will be asked
  for by a prompt).

- A service routine cliopt.c deals with querying the user for his userid and
  password in the demo programmes.

- Accepts queries near objects:
      simbad_query(hh,"~ident","") ;

- Accepts queries by galactical or ecliptical coordinates:
      simbad_query(hh,"g=gal. coord.","") ;
      simbad_query(hh,"e=ecl. coord.","") ;

- Accepts lines of any length. Especially the JP11 measurements are available

- clitime demo programme gives elapsed times.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 2.0  -  Sept 28th, 1993

- Improvement of the server stability

- Suppression of signal capture in the client routines

- simbad_query() can be called with only options, leaving the 'question'
  parameter empty.

- there is a new demo programme: clibib

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 1.1  -  July 20, 1993

- Improvement of the client application/server interactions: the server is
  more immune against crashes of a client application.

- New data available: 
  the measurements are now available, with two limitations:
     JP11 is not available
     IRAS is available, without the reference field.

- New astrotype: 
     I.0 gives a selected identifier.

- The option field in simbad_query() can be used for:
     * defining a radius when querying by coordinates
     * limiting bibliography between years

- Error management:
  All client routines return -1 or NULL when an error is encountered.
  The actual error is accessible through two functions:
     * simbad_errno() returns a general error code.
     * simbad_error() returns the text of the error message
  No error text is directly printed by the routines.
